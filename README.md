# DentallyApi

Welcome to the Dentally API Gem. It's purpose is to proved a wrapper and
example to help development of services based around [Dentally](https://dentally.co/) _The UK's leading cloud dental software_.

You can find out more about the API itself [here](https://developer.dentally.co/)

Note: This project comes about from a Dentally developer _scratching
their own itch_. It isn't officially supported by Dentally and the
company will not take support calls about it. Please contact the
developer directly, but also please remember they have a full time job
developing Dentally itself and may not be able to get back to you right
away.
